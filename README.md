# Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They provide a template for how to solve a problem in a way that has been proven to work in the past.

## History of design patterns

- Basically, the concept of design patterns was introduced in field of architecture by Christopher Alexander in his book "A Pattern Language" in 1970s.
  - In this book, he discussed how certain patterns can be indentified and applied to solve recurring design problems in architectural design.
- The idea was later adapted to software engineering in 1990s by the "Gang of Four" (GoF) in their book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" published in 1994.
  - The four people were Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, they presented 23 design patterns for Object-Oriented programming.
  - The langauge originally used in the book was C++ and Smalltalk, but the patterns can be applied to any object-oriented language.
